# VMLCB
This is a proposed algorithm, which determines the VMs locations based on their costs in internal resources, external resources and the network costs (ISP, cloud's traffic costs).
___
Network costs are generated randomly.
___
It **does not** offer the **minimum** costs always.
___
You must select the minimum costs between the _result of this algorithm, intnal costs_ and _external costs_ to achieve a good answer.
___
### Inputs
Read *Test.java* and insert your inputs in it.
The connection matrix *must* be _upper triangular matrix_.
